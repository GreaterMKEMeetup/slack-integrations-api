Subject:  Slack API 
Body: Include your github username.

# Setup
To contribute, you'll need access to the gmjm.slack.com team we use for testing.
I'll also provide you with the slack webhook URL, and secret token.  These must be kept secret!

# Where to Start
Start by taking a look at the current Issues.  See if there are any you could work on.
Create a fork of the current draft branch, and make changes there. Create a pull request
back to the draft branch when you're ready to merge.  I'll make any notes about corections there.

# Code Style
- Descriptive JavaDocs are a must
- Opening brackets on same line

# Testing
- Unit tests where possible
- Integration tests are a must.  Each feature must be proven to work against the test slack channel.
